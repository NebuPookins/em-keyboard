**Emoji your friends and colleagues from the comfort of your own
terminal.**

**em** is a nifty command-line utility for referencing emoji characters
by name. Provide the names of a few emoji, and those lucky chosen emojis
will be displayed in your terminal, then copied to your clipboard.
Automagically.

Emoji can be also searched by both categories and aspects.

## Example Usage

Let's serve some delicious cake:

    $ em sparkles cake sparkles
    Copied! ‚ú®üç∞‚ú®

Let's skip the copying (for scripts):

    $ em 'chocolate bar' --no-copy
    üç´

Let's find some emoji, by color:

    $ em -s red
    üöó  car
    üé¥  flower_playing_cards
    üëπ  japanese_ogre
    üë∫  japanese_goblin

## Installation

At this time, **em** requires Python and pip:

    $ pip install em-keyboard

That's it!

## Tests

If you wanna develop, you might want to write and run tests:

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

## Have fun!
